Bayes-Naive Algorithm
1. Predicting Interview Efficiency for IMGs: A Naive Bayes-Inspired Tool
Helping IMG's to figure out where signaling strategiesâ€”like geographic and program signals influence their interview outcomes. This Python-based tool estimates the relative efficiency of these signals in improving interview chances for IMGs in each program, using a Naive Bayes-inspired approach grounded in conditional probabilities.
Use residency explorer to get your data inputs https://www.residencyexplorer.org/.
I have only given data to include chances for each signal, and combined.
I did not include the following: step scores, visa status, and US clinical experience because it is different for every program.
